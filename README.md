# wardrobe_managment_systems
Since I was unable to use the frameworks that was suggested, I decided to use what I am skilled in. I used html,CSS and JavaScript for my frontend.
HTML is used to develop the web pages, CSS for styling and JavaScript for creating a responsive design.
Node.js and MySQL is used for the backend
In MySQL, I created a database specifically for this project. This database has two tables; users table that is used to store information of users,that is, their email and password which are used for registration and logging in, There is also a clothes table, this stores the information on clothes.
Dependencies installed for my backend are mysql2, express, dotenv,bcryptjs,body-parser and jsonwebtoken.
mysql2 allows for communication between Node.js and MySQL
express is web framework for Node.js that helps build APIs
dotenv loads enviromental variables from .env file to keep sensitive information secure
bcryptjs helps in encrypting password through hashing hence protect users sensitive information
jsonwebtoken generates and verifies secure tokens for user authentication
